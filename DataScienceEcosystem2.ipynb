    "1. Python: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for beginners. Python also has a wide range of libraries and frameworks for data science, such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. R: R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a variety of statistical and graphical techniques and is highly extensible. R is often used for data analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SQL: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to communicate with and manipulate databases. Data scientists use SQL to query, insert, update, and modify data in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Julia: Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing. It has an LLVM-based just-in-time (JIT) compiler and is well-suited for numerical and scientific computing.\n",
